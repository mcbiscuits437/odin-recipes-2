# odin-recipes-2

It's been a while since I attempted this project the first time. I have studied more HTML basics on MDN and am going to redo this project. 

tOP has updated their Git instructions so I will be getting reacquainted with this system as well. 

I will be practicing using Git/Github, creating a basic (and by design brutal) webpage/site. 

This readme will be updated after the completion of the project, with notes about what skills were used.
