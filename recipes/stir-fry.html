    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Stir fry is a quick and delicious meal that can add some zest to your midweek or weekend meal. The bright flavor of ginger and fresh, crisp vegetables paired with savory teriyaki chicken and then all poured over rice is comfort food and different all at the same time.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2-3 boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
      <li>1 large carrot</li>
      <li>2 cups broccoli-broken down into bite size pieces</li>
      <li>5-6 cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>1-2 tbsp ginger</li>
      <li>1 green onion</li>
      <li>Teriyaki sauce</li>
      <li>Toasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The key to good stir fry is getting everything prepped BEFORE you start cooking!</li>
      <li>Prep the chicken by coating with salt and pepper and cutting into about 1" cubes. Place into a bowl or plate off to the side</li>
      <li>Julienne the carrot into 2-3" sticks</li>
      <li>Slice the bell pepper into narrow strips, if it's a long pepper also cut them in half so they are closer to bite size</li>
      <li>Break the crowns of broccoli apart into small to bite size pieces</li>
      <li>Combine all cut vegetables into a bowl and put to the side</li>
      <li>Mince the garlic and grate the ginger, set these onto their own plate for later</li>
      <li>Finally, chop the green onion and set it aside for garnishing at the end</li>
      <li>Cook the chicken in large saucepan over medium to high heat until browned. Remove to a bowl/plate</li>
      <li>Without cleaning the pan, add another tbsp or two of oil and start cooking the bell pepper, broccoli, and carrots. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until the broccoli starts to soften. Don't let it cook all the way through!</li>
      <li>Add the chicken back into the dish</li>
      <li>Add the garlic and ginger and turn the heat to high, stirring and tossing frequently</li>
      <li>Season with 2-3 tbsp of teriyaki sauce and 2-3tsp of toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>Continue tossing and stirring over high heat until well mixed</li>
      <li>Remove from heat and serve over rice</li>
      <li>Garnish with the green onion and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
